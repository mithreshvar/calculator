            Gratuity is a benefit given by an employer to an employee as a token
            of appreciation for their service and loyalty. It is typically
            calculated as a certain percentage of an employeeâ€™s salary, based on
            the number of years they have worked for the company. The gratuity
            amount is paid to the employee upon the completion of a certain
            period of service or upon retirement, and is meant to provide
            financial security for the employee in their later years.

                  Calculating your gratuity can provide important information
                  about your financial future and help you make informed
                  decisions about your employment and financial planning.
                  Calculating Gratuity can help in the following ways,
                </div>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Retirement planning: Gratuity can provide a significant
                    source of income for employees during their retirement
                    years, so it's important to calculate the amount you're
                    eligible for and factor it into your retirement planning.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Financial security: Gratuity is paid to employees upon
                    retirement or completion of a certain period of service, and
                    can provide financial security during a time when regular
                    income may have ceased.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Understanding your benefits: Calculating your gratuity can
                    help you understand your total employee benefits package and
                    how much you will receive when you retire or leave the
                    company.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Negotiating employment terms: If you're considering a job
                    offer, calculating your potential gratuity can help you
                    determine the total compensation package and make an
                    informed decision about the offer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Budgeting: Calculating your gratuity can help you plan your
                    budget and ensure that you have enough money to meet your
                    financial obligations, both now and in the future.

                    The amount of gratuity for employees whose employer is
                    covered under the Gratuity Act can be calculated using the
                    formula:
                    <div>Gratuity = n*b*15 / 26</div>
                    <div>

                    </div>
                    <div>b = Last drawn basic salary + dearness allowance</div>
                    As per the Gratuity Act, the amount of gratuity cannot be
                    more than Rs 20 lakh. Any excesses would be treated as

                      employment is more than six months, then it will be
                      rounded to the nearest figure. Suppose your tenure of
                      service is 16 years 7 months, then you receive the
                      gratuity for 17 years. Otherwise, its for 16 years if it
                      happens to be 16 years 4 months.

                    For employees whose employer is not covered under the
                    Gratuity Act, the gratuity amount would be calculated as per
                    the half-month salary on each completed year of service.
